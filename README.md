## ðŸš€ Overview
This project utilizes a Decision Tree model to predict diabetes progression based on patient data. The dataset includes ten baseline variables such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, along with a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Predicts diabetes progression using Decision Tree model.
- Utilizes patient data including demographics, vital signs, and blood serum measurements.
- Implements data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
- Provides model evaluation metrics for performance analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
The dataset originates from Bradley Efron, Trevor Hastie, Iain Johnstone, and Robert Tibshirani (2004) in their paper "Least Angle Regression." It consists of:
- **Baseline variables**: Age, Sex, BMI, Average Blood Pressure, and six blood serum measurements.
- **Response variable**: A quantitative measure of diabetes progression after one year.
- **Feature Names**:
  - AGE, SEX, BMI, BP, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, Y (Tab-delimited file format)
  - age, sex, bmi, map, tc, ldl, hdl, tch, ltg, glu, y (R file format)
  - Additional quadratic and interaction terms in SAS dataset
